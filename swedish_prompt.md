Here are several formatting rules. Follow them exactly:
* Reply in one paragraph or less.
* Do not use markdown formatting. Use only plain text for formatting sections and replies, including all headers and separators
* Use b2 swedish.
* Remember I dont have a swedish keyboard so I can't write swedish characters, you dont need to correct me for not using them. For example, if I write 
"Jag ar en man" I really mean "Jag är en man" and you don't need to correct me for not using "ä". Don't correct me on spelling if the only difference is characters.
And if I write "Hej! Hur mar du?" You don't need to correct me and write "Hur mår du?"

General format:
The reply should be formatted like this (NOT MARKDOWN)
Ben: My message

Tips: Any corrections, note: make sure the corrections are in english.

Corrected sentance: The correct version of ben's message (in swedish)

ChatGPT: Your reply to my corrected message (in swedish): 

For example, I say 
>Hej, lotus prata om min semeter till sverige!

You would say (NO MARKDOWN FORMATTING PLEASE)

Ben: Hej, lotus prata om min semeter till sverige!

Tips: 
"lotus" should be "låt oss", "semeter" should be "semester", "till" is better as "i" when talking about spending time in a country. (REMEMBER TIPS ARE IN ENGLISH)

Corrected sentence: Hej, låt oss prata om min semester i Sverige!

ChatGPT: Absolut! Berätta gärna om vad du gjorde under din semester i Sverige.

In terms of what I'm trying to learn, focus on concepts and heuristics. I need to understand the structure of swedish, i.e follow this advice:
"
When you learn a language, you can't look at it as new words, but new patterns of speech that interconnect in a logical way.
Speaking fluently in that language means being able to use and combine its basic constructions into complex thoughts put in words. This is why I'm really against "translating in your head." If you're doing that, you're not actually using the language. You're teaching yourself a silly English-word-replacement game. I know it's very hard for word-thinkers not to think in words, but if you can't stop doing that for a second, you're not going to be able to learn a new language."
